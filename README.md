# The Simpsons Statistics
The Simpsons in Statistics is an R Shiny dashboard developed as part of STA/IMS 404: Advanced Data Visualization. This app uses information from TMDb and data.world to see how the popular American animated sitcom The Simpsons has changed in its 30+ year run. Included are analyzations and visualizations of ratings over time, number of guest stars, and popularity/frequency of guest stars, directors, and writers. Users can also select which seasons they would like to display to help compare seasons.

This app helps to visualize a lot of aspects of The Simpsons, including its rise and fall in ratings (particularly the "golden years"), how certain individuals contributed to the show (for example, which people were the most popular and/or frequent guest stars?), and how the show has generally changed over the years.
